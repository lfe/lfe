NAME
       lfe_comp - Lisp Flavoured Erlang (LFE) compiler

SYNOPSIS
       This  module  provides  an interface to the standard LFE compiler.  The
       compiler can handle files which contain multiple modules.  It can  gen‐
       erate  either  new files which contain the object code, or return bina‐
       ries which can be loaded directly.

EXPORTS
       file(FileName) -> CompRet

       Is the same as file(FileName, [report]).

       file(FileName, Options) -> CompRet

       where

              CompRet = ModRet | BinRet | ErrRet
              ModRet = {ok,[ModOk]} | {ok,[ModOk],Warnings}
              ModOk  = {ok,ModuleName} | {ok,ModuleName,Warnings}
              BinRet = {ok,[ModBin]} | {ok,[ModBin],Warnings}
              ModBin = {ok,ModuleName,Binary} | {ok,ModuleName,Binary,Warnings}
              ErrRet = error | {error,[ModErr],Errors,Warnings}
              ModErr = {error,Errors,Warnings}

       Compile an LFE file, either writing the generated modules to  files  or
       returning  them  as  binaries.   The  generated modules are ready to be
       loaded into Erlang.

       The currently recognised options are:

       · binary - Return the binary of the module and do  not  save  it  in  a
         file.

       · no_docs, no-docs - Do not parse docstrings and write the "LDoc" chunk
         in the binary of the module.

       · to_expand, to-expand - Print a listing of the macro expanded LFE code
         in  the file .expand.  No object file is produced.  Mainly useful for
         debugging and interest.

       · to_lint, to-lint - Print a listing of the macro expanded  and  linted
         LFE  code  in the files .lint.  No object files are produced.  Mainly
         useful for debugging and interest.

       · to_core0, to-core0, to_core, to-core - Print a listing  of  the  Core
         Erlang  code before/after being optimised in the files .core.  No ob‐
         ject files are produced.  Mainly useful for debugging and interest.

       · to_kernel, to-kernel - Print a listing of the Kernel Erlang  code  in
         the  files .kernel.  No object files are produced.  Mainly useful for
         debugging and interest.

       · to_asm, to-asm - Print a listing of the Beam code in  the  files  .S.
         No object files are produced.  Mainly useful for debugging and inter‐
         est.

       · {outdir,Dir}, [outdir,Dir] - Save the generated files in director Dir
         instead of the current directory.

       · {i,Dir},  [i,Dir] - Add dir to the list of directories to be searched
         when including a file.

       · report - Print the errors and warnings as they occur.

       · return - Return an extra return field containing Warnings on  success
         or  the errors and warnings in {error,Errors,Warnings} when there are
         errors.

       · debug_print, debug-print - Causes the compiler to print a lot of  de‐
         bug information.

       · warnings_as_errors, warnings-as-errors - Causes warnings to be treat‐
         ed as errors.

       · no_export_macros, no-export-macros - Do not export macros  from  mod‐
         ules.

       If  the  binary option is given then options that produce listing files
       will cause the internal formats for that compiler pass to be returned.

       Both Warnings and Errors have the following format:

              [{FileName,[ErrorInfo]}]

       ErrorInfo is described below.  When generating Errors and Warnings  the
       line number is the line of the start of the form in which the error oc‐
       curred.  The file name has been included here to be compatible with the
       Erlang  compiler.   As yet there is no extra information about included
       files.

       forms(Forms) -> CompRet

       Is the same as forms(Forms, [report]).

       forms(Forms, Options) -> CompRet

       where

              Forms = [sexpr()]
              CompRet = BinRet | ErrRet
              BinRet = {ok,[ModBin]} | {ok,[ModBin],Warnings}
              ModBin = {ok,ModuleName,Binary} | {ok,ModuleName,Binary,Warnings}
              ErrRet = error | {error,[ModErr],Errors,Warnings}
              ModErr = {error,Errors,Warnings}

       Compile the forms as an LFE module returning a binary.   This  function
       takes  the  same  options as lfe_comp:file/1/2.  When generating Errors
       and Warnings the "line number" is the index of the form  in  which  the
       error occured.

       format_error(Error) -> Chars

       Uses an ErrorDescriptor and returns a deep list of characters which de‐
       scribes the error.  This function is usually called implicitly when  an
       ErrorInfo structure is processed.  See below.

ERROR INFORMATION
       The ErrorInfo mentioned above is the standard ErrorInfo structure which
       is returned from all IO modules.  It has the following format:

       {ErrorLine,Module,ErrorDescriptor}

       A string describing the error is obtained with the following call:

              Module:format_error(ErrorDescriptor)
