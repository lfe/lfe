MODULE SUMMARY

        Lisp Flavoured Erlang (LFE) shell

DESCRIPTION

        There is now a simple LFE shell in which you can enter sexprs
        which are evaluated and the value printed. You can define
        functions and macros as well as set variables.

Built-in shell functions

        These are defined as normal functions and macros and can be
        called from anywhere in the shell. They can even be redefined.
        They can also be explicitly called (: lfe_shell ...).

        (c File [Options])
                Compile and load an LFE file. Assumes default
                extension .lfe.

        (ec File [Options])
                Compile and load an Erlang file.

        (i)
                Print information about the currently running
                processes in the system.

        (l Module ...)
                Load modules.

        (m Module ...)
                Print out module information, if no modules are given
                then print information about all modules.

        (pid x y z)
                Create a pid from x, y, z.

        (p Expr)
        (pp Expr)
                Print/prettyprint a value to full depth.

        (regs)
                Print information about the currently running
                processes in the system.

        (: c Command Arg ...)
                All the commands in the standard Erlang shell can be
                reached in this way.

Built-in shell commands

        These are special forms which are only recognised at the
        top-level in shell input. The cannot be redefined.

        (reset-environment)
                Resets the environment to its initial state.

        (set Pattern Expr)
        (set Pattern (when Guard) Expr)
                Evaluate Expr and match the result with Pattern
                binding variables in it. These variables can then be
                used in the shell and also rebound in another set.

        (slurp File)
                Slurp in a source LFE file and makes all functions and
                macros defined in the file available in the
                shell. Only one file can be slurped at a time and
                slurping a new file basically does an unslurp first.

        (unslurp)
                Revert back to the state before the last slurp
                removing all function and macro definitions both in
                the slurped file and defined in the shell since then.

        (run File)
                Execute all the shell commands in File. All defined
                variables, functions and macros will be saved in the
                environment if there are no errors.

Built-in shell variables

        +/++/+++
                The three previous expressions input.

        */**/***
                The values of the previous 3 expressions.

        -
                The current expression input.

Shell Environment

        The shell maintains an environment of local function and macro
        definitions, and variable bindings. The environment can be
        accessed using the built-in shell variable $ENV. This can be
        useful when calling functions like macroexpand and
        macro-function which unless an explicit environment is given
        will only search the defualt environment.


Starting the LFE shell

        After installing the best way is probably to start Erlang
        directly running the LFE shell with:

        lfe [flags]

        From a normal Erlang shell the best way to start the shell is
        by calling:

        17> lfe_shell:server().

        Giving the user switch commands:

        --> s lfe_shell
        --> c

        will create a job running the LFE shell and connect to
        it. This also works when starting a remote shell.

Running LFE shell scripts

        The LFE shell can also be directly called to run LFE shell
        scripts with:

        lfe [flags] file [args]

        This will start the shell, run a script with LFE shell
        commands and then terminate the shell. The following built-in
        variables are also bound:

        script-name
                The name of the script file as a string.

        script-args
                A list of the arguments to the script as strings. If
                no arguments have been given then this will be an
                empty list.
