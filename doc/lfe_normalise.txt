NAME
       lfe_normalise - LFE normalised internal compiler format

SYNOPSIS
       This  in  an  internal  module of the compiler which converts the input
       forms after macro expansion for to a set of  normalised  forms,  norms,
       which are used internally in the compiler.  These are generally not di‐
       rectly used by the user.

NORMALISED FORMS
       These are defined normalised forms.

   Predefined attributes
       (module line-number module-name)

       (export line-number exported-functions | all)

       (import line-number imports)

       (compile line-number options)

       (on_load line-number function)

       (nifs functions)

       (type line-number type type-def)

       (opaque line-number type type-def)

       (export-type line-number types)

       (module-alias line-number aliases)

       (record line-number record-name record-fields)

       (struct line-number struct-fields)

       (spec line-number spec-function specs) spec-function -> (name arity)

       (macro line-number macro-name macro-def)

       (function line-number function-name function-def)

   General attribute
       (attribute line-number name value) attribute name -> atom

       Basically  everything  which  isn’t  a  predefined  form becomes an at‐
       tribute.

USE IN CODE
       Norms written without the line number can actually be used in code.  So
       for example we could write the code

              (defmodule this-module
                (export (a 0) (c 3))
                )

       as

              (module this-module)

              (export (a 0) (c 3))
