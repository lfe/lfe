NAME
       lfe_cl - LFE Common Lisp interface library

SYNOPSIS
       This  module provides a set of Common Lisp functions and macros for use
       in LFE.  The definitions closely follow the CL definitions and won't be
       documented here.

DATA TYPES
       The  boolean  values  used here are the standard LFE true and false and
       NOT the Common Lisp values.

EXPORTS
   Boolean conversion functions
       make-lfe-bool cl-value

       make-cl-bool lfe-bool

   Control structures
       do vars (end-test result) body                            [macro]

       The value of body is bound the variable do-state which can be used when
       updating vars and in the end-test.  This is the only way to get a value
       out of the body.

       mapcar function list

       maplist function list

       mapc function list

       mapl function list

   Symbol functions
       symbol-plist symbol

       symbol-name symbol

       get symbol pname

       get symbol pname default

       getl symbol pname-list

       putprop symbol value pname

       remprop symbol pname

       Atoms (symbols) in LFE don't have property lists associated with  them.
       However,  here  we  have  experimented  with  having a global ETS table
       lfe-symbol-plist which associates an atom with a property  list.   This
       is very unLFEy, but quite fun.

   Property list functions
       getf plist pname

       getf plist pname default

       putf plist value pname

       remf plist pname

       get-properties plist pname-list

       The  function  putf/3  does not exist in Common Lisp but is included to
       complete the operations on property lists.

   Simple sequence functions
       elt index sequence

       length sequence

       reverse sequence

   Concatenation, mapping and reducing functions
       some predicate sequence

       every predicate sequence

       notany predicate sequence

       reduce function sequence 'initial-value x

       reduce function sequence 'from-end 'true

       reduce function sequence 'initial-value x 'from-end 'true

   Modifying sequences
       remove item sequence

       remove-if predicate sequence

       remove-if-not predicate sequence

       remove-duplicates sequence

       substitute new old sequence

       substitute-if predicate sequence

       substitute-if-not predicate sequence

   Searching sequences
       find item sequence

       find-if predicate sequence

       find-if-not predicate sequence

       find-duplicates sequence

       position item sequence

       count-if-not predicate sequence

   Lists
       car list

       first list

       cdr list

       rest list

       nth index list

       nthcdr index list

       last list

       butlast list

   Substitution of expressions
       subst new old tree

       subst-if new test tree

       subst-if-not new test tree

       sublis alist tree

   Lists as sets
       member item list

       member-if predicate list

       member-if-not predicate list

       adjoin item list

       union list list

       intersection list list

       set-difference list list

       set-exclusive-or list list

       subsetp list list

   Association list functions
       acons key data alist

       pairlis list list

       pairlis list list alist

       assoc key alist

       assoc-if predicate alost

       assoc-if-not predicate alost

       rassoc key alist

       rassoc-if predicate alost

       rassoc-if-not predicate alost

   Types
       type-of object

       coerce object type

   Type testing macros
       There is an include file which developers may which to utilize in their
       LFE  programs:  (include-lib "lfe/include/cl.lfe").  Currently this of‐
       fers Common Lisp predicates, but may include other  useful  macros  and
       functions  in the future.  The provided predicate macros wrap the vari‐
       ous is_* Erlang functions; since these are expanded  at  compile  time,
       they are usable in guards.  It includes the following:

       alivep x

       atomp x

       binaryp x

       bitstringp x

       boolp x

       booleanp x

       builtinp x

       floatp x

       funcp x

       functionp x

       intp x and integerp x

       listp x

       mapp x

       numberp x

       pidp x

       process-alive-p x

       recordp x tag

       recordp x tag size

       refp x

       referencep x

       tuplep x
