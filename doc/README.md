# LFE Documentation

Please note that the ``.txt`` files in this directory and the man page files
in the ``man`` directory are generated by ``make`` targets and should not be
edited.

The single "source of truth" for LFE docs are the ``.md`` files in the
``src`` directory.

For more information, please see:

* [Updating LFE documentation](src/updating_docs.md)
