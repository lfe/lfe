# LFE

LFE, Lisp Flavoured Erlang, is a lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang
compiler. Code produced with it is compatible with "normal" Erlang
code. An LFE evaluator and shell is also included.


## Installation

LFE can be installed in different ways depending on how it is intended
to be used:

* use [lfetool](https://github.com/lfe/lfetool) to create projects (which will
  automatically have LFE as a dependency when it creates skeleton libraries,
  OTP apps, etc.; or
* use LFE directly in a working dir, e.g.:

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/rvirding/lfe.git
    $ cd lfe
    $ make compile
```

The second alternative compiles all the files. After this has been
done programs for starting the REPL and compiling LFE files can be
installed with:

```shell
    $ make install
```

By default this will create the programs ``lfe``, ``lfec`` and
``lfescript`` in the same directory as the ``erl`` program. This can
changed by defining the make variable ``DESTBINDIR`` to point to the
desired directory. So:

```shell
    $ make install DESTBINDIR=/Users/rv/bin
```

will put the programs in ``/Users/rv/bin``.

## REPL

If you have used ``lfetool`` to set up your project, you can simply do this to
start a REPL:

```shell
    $ make shell
    Erlang 17 (erts-6.0) [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] ...

    LFE Shell 6.0 (abort with ^G)
    >
```

Note that this will recompile all the deps (often useful for projects with
changing dependencies). If you would prefer to only recompile code for the
project itself, you can use ``make shell-no-deps`` instead.

If you're running LFE from a git clone working dir, you can start the REPL
like so:

```shell
    $ lfe
    Erlang 17 (erts-6.0) [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] ...

    LFE Shell V6.0 (abort with ^G)
    >
```

and run an LFE shell script in the same style as shell scripts with:

```shell
    $ lfe script-name script-arg-1 ...
```

## Usage

The [docs site](http://lfe.github.io/docs.html) has several places to explore
that will show you how to start using LFE. However, here's a quick taste:

* start up an LFE REPL as demonstrated above
* then, do something like this:
```cl
    > (* 2 (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6))
    42
    > (* 2 (lists:foldl (lambda (n acc) (+ n acc)) 0 (lists:seq 1 6)))
    42
```

## Docker Support

LFE now supports Docker. To get started, simply do the following, once you
have Docker set up on your machine:

```bash
$ docker pull lfex/lfe
```

Alternatively, you could build the image yourself:

```bash
$ cd lfe
$ docker build .
```

Here are a couple of simple usage examples:

```bash
$ docker run lfex/lfe
42
$ docker run -t -i lfex/lfe /usr/bin/lfe
```

That last command will dump you into the LFE REPL on a running container
of the ``lfex/lfe`` Docker image. For more information on using Docker
with LFE, be sure to read the
[tutorial](http://blog.lfe.io/tutorials/2014/12/07/1837-running-lfe-in-docker/).
