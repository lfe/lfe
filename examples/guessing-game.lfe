;; File    : guessing-game.lfe
;; Author  : Duncan McGreggor
;; Purpose : Demonstrating a random-number guessing game (classic BASIC-era
;;           demo)

;; This file contains a simple demo for guessing a random number, chosen by
;; "the computer". To use, do the following:
;;
;;  $ ../bin/lfe -pa ../ebin
;; > (slurp '"examples/guessing-game.lfe")
;; #(ok guessing-game)
;; > (main)
;; Guess the number I have chosen, between 1 and 10.
;; Guess number: 10
;; Your guess is too high.
;; Guess number: 1
;; Your guess is too low.
;; Guess number: 5
;; Your guess is too low.
;; Guess number: 7
;; Well-guessed!!
;; ok
;; >

(defmodule guessing-game
  (export (main 0)))

        (check-guess answer (get-player-guess)))))
