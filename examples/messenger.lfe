;; File    : messenger.lfe
;; Author  : Duncan McGreggor
;; Purpose : Demonstrating message passing to spawned processes

;; This file contains a simple demo for passing messages to an Erlang process
;; in LFE. To use, do the following:
;;
;;  $ ../bin/lfe -pa ../ebin
;;  > (c '"messenger")
;;  #(module messenger)
;;  > (set pid (spawn 'messenger 'print-result ()))
;;  <0.34.0>
;;  > (! pid '"Zaphod was here.")
;;  "Zaphod was here."
;;  Received message: 'Zaphod was here.'
;;  > (! pid '"Ford is missing.")
;;  "Ford is missing."
;;  Received message: 'Ford is missing.'
;;  > (! pid '"Arthur is pining for Trillian.")
;;  "Arthur is pining for Trillian."
;;  Received message: 'Arthur is pining for Trillian.'

(defmodule messenger
 (export (print-result 0)))

(defun print-result ()
  (receive
    (msg
      (: io format '"Received message: '~s'~n" (list msg))
      (print-result))))
