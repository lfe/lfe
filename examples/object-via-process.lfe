;; Author  : Duncan McGreggor
;; Purpose : Demonstrating simple OOP with lightweight Erlang processes

;; The simple object system demonstrated below shows how to do the following:
;;  * create objects
;;  * call methods on those objects
;;  * have methods which can call other methods
;;  * update the state of an instance variable
;;
;; Note, however, that his example does not demonstrate inheritance.
;;
;; To use the code below in LFE, do the following:
;;
;;  $ cd examples
;;  $ ../bin/lfe -pa ../ebin
;;
;; Load the file and create a fish-class instance:
;;
;; > (slurp '"object-via-process.lfe")
;; #(ok object-via-process)
;; > (set mommy-fish (fish-class '"Carp"))
;; <0.33.0>
;;
;; Execute some of the basic methods:
;;
;; > (get-species mommy-fish)
;; "Carp"
;; > (move mommy-fish 17)
;; The Carp swam 17 feet!
;; ok
;; > (get-id mommy-fish)
;; "47eebe91a648f042fc3fb278df663de5"
;;
;; Now let's look at modifying state data (e.g., children counts):
;;
;; > (get-children mommy-fish)
;; ()
;; > (get-children-count mommy-fish)
;; 0
;; > (set baby-fish-1 (reproduce mommy-fish))
;; <0.34.0>
;; > (get-id mommy-fish)
;; "47eebe91a648f042fc3fb278df663de5"
;; > (get-id baby-fish-1)
;; "fdcf35983bb496650e558a82e34c9935"
;; > (get-children-count mommy-fish)
;; 1
;; > (set baby-fish-2 (reproduce mommy-fish))
;; <0.35.0>
;; > (get-id mommy-fish)
;; "47eebe91a648f042fc3fb278df663de5"
;; > (get-id baby-fish-2)
;; "3e64e5c20fb742dd88dac1032749c2fd"
;; > (get-children-count mommy-fish)
;; 2
;; > (get-info mommy-fish)
;; id: 47eebe91a648f042fc3fb278df663de5
;; species: Carp
;; children: ["fdcf35983bb496650e558a82e34c9935",

  This constructor is useful for two reasons:
    1) as a way of abstracting out the id generation from the
       larger constructor, and
    2) spawning the 'object loop' code (fish-class/3).
